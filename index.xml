      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>

      <description>I will start by speeking how did i know R for the first time. I remember it was in the second year of my engineering degree in computer science. Me and my classmates knew R in the course of knowledge engineering. In 2007/2008, i was in my second year in my M.Sc. degree, and my supervisor was our instructor of the knowledge engineering course who was a very competent teacher and supervisor and who loves her job.</description>
